	<p><b>Biography :</b></p>

He graduated from the Belgrade high school, and attended the natural science and mathematics
 section of the University of Belgrade. In 1879 he traveled to Munich where he studied music
 in the class of Josef Rheinberger. After a brief break, he continued to study in Rome in the 
 class of Parisotti, in 1884. Returning to Serbia in 1884 he briefly became the conductor of 
 the Kornelije Stanković choir of Belgrade.</li><br>
		<li>From 1885 to 1887 he studied music in Leipzig, Germany. Upon his return to Serbia

		1887 to 1900 he taught music at the Belgrade high school, and in 1901 transferred to

				"handfuls" or "bunches") - a collection of songs and music (orchestral suites) 
				based on motives of Serbian folk music from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia Proper,
				Montenegro, Kosovo and Metohija, Macedonia and Bulgaria. His other prominent folk-based
				works include Primorski napjevi (Coastland tunes), and Kozar.

				<li>A significant number of his works were made for church services.
				Such as the Božanstvena Liturgija Svetog Jovana Zlatoustog
				(The Divine Liturgy of St. Chrysostom),
				from which the Heruvimska pesma (Cherubic hymn) is most famous.
				Another two famous religious pieces are Tebe Boga hvalim (Te Deum)
				and Veličanije Sv. Savi (Megalynarion to St. Sava).
